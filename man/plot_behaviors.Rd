\title{Plot Human and Mosquito Behaviors by Hour}
\usage{
plot_behaviors(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe (typically the output of \code{\link{calculate_Exp}}) containing the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{hour} – hour of the day (0–23),
\item \code{p_in} – proportion of users indoors (not under a net),
\item \code{p_net} – proportion of users under a net,
\item \code{Bi_t} – indoor mosquito biting rate,
\item \code{Bo_t} – outdoor mosquito biting rate.
}}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot2} plot object with a stacked area chart for human behavior (on the primary Y-axis)
and line plots for mosquito biting rates (on the secondary Y-axis), with hours centered on midnight.
}
\description{
Generates a dual-axis plot showing the hourly variation in human behavior (proportion of individuals indoors and under bednets)
and mosquito biting behavior (biting rates indoors and outdoors). Human behavior is shown as a stacked area plot on the
primary Y-axis, while mosquito biting rates are shown as lines on the secondary Y-axis. Hours are centered on midnight.

\examples{
# Assuming `result` is the output from `calculate_Exp()`
plot_behaviors(result)
